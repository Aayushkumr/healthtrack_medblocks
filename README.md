# HealthTrack – Offline-First Patient Management System

## Overview

**HealthTrack** is a modern offline-first patient management system built for healthcare providers. It enables efficient registration, tracking, and management of patient data, even in environments with unreliable internet connectivity.

Designed with a focus on user experience and data reliability, HealthTrack uses **PGlite**, a fully featured SQL database that runs entirely in the browser.
