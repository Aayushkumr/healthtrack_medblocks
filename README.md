# HealthTrack – Offline-First Patient Management System


## Overview

**HealthTrack** is a modern, offline-first patient management system built for healthcare providers. It enables efficient registration, tracking, and management of patient data, even in environments with unreliable internet connectivity.

Built with a focus on user experience and data reliability, HealthTrack uses **PGlite**, a fully-featured SQL database that runs entirely in the browser.

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  date_of_birth TEXT NOT NULL,
  gender TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  address TEXT,
  medical_notes TEXT,
  insurance_provider TEXT,
  insurance_id TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Offline Functionality

HealthTrack is designed to work entirely offline after the initial load. It:

* Stores all patient data in the browser’s IndexedDB
* Allows patient registration without an internet connection
* Preserves full functionality offline
* Has no backend dependencies for core operations

---

## Usage Guide

### Dashboard

Provides quick access to core functions and displays key metrics.

### Patient Registration

Fill out the registration form with required fields (marked with `*`) and optional details. Form validation ensures accurate data entry.

### Patient List

View and search through all registered patients. Information is presented in a clean, tabular format.

### Query Interface
